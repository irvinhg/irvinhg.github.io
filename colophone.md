This website was made entirely without Javascript, to keep it lean and quick. I used Jekyll, a static blog generator, and created my own theme from scratch.

I was heavily inspired by other Jekyll themes as Ghost and some HTML5Up.net examples.

I used ImgIX as a CDN to serve blazing fast images, as well as AWS S3 for storage.
