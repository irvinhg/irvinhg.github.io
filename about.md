### About me ###
<p></p>

I'm a Software Engineer currently based in Paris, France. I enjoy reading a good book, watching a classical film in a calm Sunday night and travelling every chance I get. I got my Bacherlor's degree in Electronic Engineering in 2011, worked for a little bit and then decided to come to Paris to get my Master's degree in Networked Computer Systems. I've been living here ever since.

### Past work ###
<p></p>

#### Expedia Group ####
<p></p>

I'm currently working for *Expedia Group*, in the business-to-business branch. It's a very cool environment that's ever changing, many different challenges in the world of travel.

#### Cloud Orchestration Team ####
<p></p>

I worked for a while in the cloud orchestration team at *Dassault Systèmes*, I had a great time and met some very interesting people. The goal of our team/project was to deploy production-ready applications on different clouds using our own cloud abstraction tool. We provided some other cloud abstractions for zero-downtime upgrades, sandbox deployments, etc.

#### Web Dashboard Solution ####
<p></p>
Also at *Dassault Systèmes* I worked in a completely customizable Web Dashboard Application where users can work collaboratively to bring solutions to complex problems. By using prepackaged widgets, or making their own, users can manage their information to see just what they need to make smart and quick decisions. In a world where there is so much information being generated everyday, using these types of tools is key to making smart and quick decisions that can make your business grow more efficiently.

#### Web User-Interface Components ####
<p></p>
Apart from working on the general solution of the Web Dashboard, I also developped several UI components that were the basis for other web applications within the *Dassault Systèmes* ecosystem of applications. An example of an UI component I developed is a dynamic tree-based navigation component in which developers could define a base (root) and generate the tree navigation dynamically depending on their data.

#### Widget/App development ####
<p></p>
As part of *Dassault Systèmes* Web Dashboard solution, there are included several widgets to help improve the productivity of users in the Dashboard. Examples of widgets I developed where a *Google Drive* integration, Bookmark manager, Webpage/Media viewer, *ZoHo* integration, Feed Reader & others.

### Interests & Hobbies ###
<p></p>
I love running, biking, hiking and the general outdoors. I find myself playing bass from time to time and just enjoying a good time out with my friends. One day I hope I'll be good at mountain biking, for the moment I just find myself falling... a lot.
